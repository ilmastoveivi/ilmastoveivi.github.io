## Goal

Finland will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2019 from July to December. We at Ilmastoveivi2019 intend on making use of this opportunity to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Finland will have the mandate to make a motion to update the 2030 and 2050 target levels put forth in the 2020 climate & energy package. This will put the EU on the right track to reach the ambitious, but necessary goal of 1.5 degrees.


## How do we achieve this

In order to achieve this goal, Ilmastoveivi2019 is looking to collect 500,000 signatures for our petition, which will be handed over to the new prime minister of Finland in the spring of 2019.

The campaign aims to connect Finns – regardless of age, background, and life situation – for the sake of preventing climate change. Together through Ilmastoveivi2019, we insist that Finland must take the leading position in preventing climate change.
